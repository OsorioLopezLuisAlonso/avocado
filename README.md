# The purpose of this database is to illustrate the fluctuation of the selling prices & quantity reported by the US retailers to the Hass Avocado Board from 2017 to the 3Q of 2020. I've made some assumptions to generate sales analysis that could provide insight to the Mexican producers as Mexico is the lead producer of Avocados with 33% of the global share. 

#I'm posting the analysis made, along with the raw files.
